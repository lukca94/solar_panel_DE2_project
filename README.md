### Preparation
In order to create solar monitoring with current sensor, four photoresistors and OLED display, which monitors the current and power value. First thing to do was creating a schemematic and system algorithm.
OLED display uses I2C interface. Libraries created or learned about in AVR DE2 course were updated and used in this project. 

Structure of code

- Servo rotation
- photoresistor monitoring
- automative servo motor rotation
- values storing
- OLED displaying values
